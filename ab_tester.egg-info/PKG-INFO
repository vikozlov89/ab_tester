        The libarry includes some useful functions and classes for A/B testing.
        
        ## Modules
        
        * bootstrap - includes classes with different simulators implementations and utility functions for analyzing simulation 
        results
        * proportions - includes functions for testing proportions as there is no out-of-the-box implementations in other 
        libraries as far as we know
        * cuped - simple implementation of CUPED
        * sample_analysis - utility functions for analyzing test and control samples and performing a factor analysis to find 
         out the reason of difference between test and control
        * plotting - utility functions for plotting simulation results or test power vs sample size
